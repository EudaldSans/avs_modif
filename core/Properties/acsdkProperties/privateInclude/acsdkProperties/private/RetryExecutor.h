/**
 * @brief Helper class to execute with retries.
 *
 * This class handles operation errors and retries. Whenever operation fails, an error callback is notified, and then
 * decision is made to retry operation, fail it, or mark operation for cleanup action.
 *
 * Executor isn't aware of operation specifics, but it gets \ref OperationType and namespace URI when constructed,
 * executes given operation, and works with \ref RetryableOperationResult. For improved debugging, the classes.
 *
 * This class also provides functions to set (change) error callback interface to use whenever an operation encounters
 * an error. The number of retries can be limited, and when the retry limit is reached, the class marks operation as
 * failed even if error callback requests a retry.
 *
 * The class uses the same retry counter for all invocations, so if any of the operations fail, this reduces total
 * number of retry attempts.
 *
 * The class shall be used as follows:
 * @code
 * RetryExecutor executor(OperationType::Open, "namespaceUri");
 * auto action = execute("actionName", []() -> RetryableOperationResult {
 *    .. do something
 *    if (success) {
 *       return RetryExecutor::SUCCESS;
 *    } else {
 *       // Indicate the operation has failed, but the failure is retryable.
 *       return RetryExecutor::RETRYABLE_INNER_PROPERTIES_ERROR;
 *    }
 * }, Action::FAIL);
 *
 * // now follow up on result
 * switch (action} {
 * when Action::SUCCESS:
 *   // Handle success.
 *   ...
 *   break;
 * when Action::FAIL:
 *   // Handle failure.
 *   ...
 *   break;
 * when Action::CLEAR_DATA:
 *   // Clear data and continue.
 *   ...
 *   break;
