 * \defgroup PropertiesAPI Properties API
 * @brief Interfaces for accessing persistent configuration.
 *
 * Properties API provides interfaces for accessing persistent configuration. The API doesn't mandate how the
 * configuration is stored, but assumes that it can be accessed as a group of containers. A single container can be
 * identified by configuration URI (Uniform ResourceLocator).
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * \code{.cpp}
 * auto properties = propertiesFactory->getProperties("componentName/tableName");
 * properties->putString("propertyName", "stringValue");
 * \endcode
 *
 * ACSDK provides reference implementation of \ref PropertiesAPI to use with \ref MiscStorageInterface and to store
 * properties values in encrypted form. See \ref PropertiesIMPL for documentation on reference implementation.
