/**
 * @defgroup CryptoPKCS11Stubs Test Stubs for PKCS#11 Library
 * @brief HSM function stubs for @a CryptoAPI.
 *
 * This module provide bare-bone stub functionality subset from PKCS#11 specification. Only few functions are
 * implemented, and code can expect the following:
 * - There is only one hardcoded slot with ACSDK token name.
 * - User PIN is hardcoded to 1234 value.
 * - There are two object that corresponds to AES-256 and AES-128 keys with TEST_KEY name.
 * - Code supports AES encryption and decryption operations using @ref CryptoIMPL.
 *
 * This is a test support module, and must not be used either for integration tests or in production.
