 * @brief Digest computation interface.
 *
 * This interface wraps up logic for computing various digest types (SHA-2, RC5, etc.).
 *
 * To compute the digest, the user shall call any of @a process methods to consume all input data, and when all data
 * is consume, call #finalize to get the result.

 * auto digest = cryptoFactory->createDigest(DigestType::SHA256);

 * codec->finalize(&digestData);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The instance of the class is reusable, and it also can be used if any of the methods returned
 * an error code after call to #reset().
 *
 * ### Thread Safety
 *
 * This interface is not thread safe and caller must ensure only one thread can make calls at any time.
