/**
 * @brief Key Store Interface.
 *
 * Interface provides integration with platform-specific key storage and operations. The vendor can choose how to
 * implement this interface for a best security.
 *
 * This interface enables data encryption and decryption without accessing encryption key data. Keys must be provided
 * by device manufacturer (vendor), and cryptography functions access those keys through key aliases.
 *
 * ACSDK provides a reference implementation of this interface to integrate with Hardware Security Module through
 * PKCS#11 API.
 *
 * ### Thread Safety
 *
 * This interface is thread safe and can be used concurrently by different threads.
