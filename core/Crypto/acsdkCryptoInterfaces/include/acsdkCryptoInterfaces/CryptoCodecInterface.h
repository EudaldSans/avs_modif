/**
 * @brief Crypto codec (cipher) interface.
 *
 * This interface provides functions to encrypt and decrypt the data, and behaviour depends on the way the interface is
 * created. See @ref CryptoFactoryInterface for details on this interface creation.
 *
 * * * *
 * ### Using Encryption and Decryption without Authentication
 *
 * For encryption without authentication, the algorithm takes key, initialization vector, and plaintext (unencrypted
 * data) as inputs, and produces ciphertext (encrypted data) as output. Application must keep the key secret, while
 * initialization vector can be stored or transferred along ciphertext.
 *
 * For decryption without authentication, the algorithm takes key, initialization vector, and ciphertext (encrypted
 * data) as inputs, and produces plaintext (unencrypted data) as output. When decrypting, key and initialization vector
 * must match the ones, provided during decryption.
 *
 * Codec must be initialized before use with a call to CryptoCodecInterface::init method. The data is encrypted or
 * decrypted with subsequent calls to CryptoCodecInterface::process. Because the codec may cache some of the output
 * inside internal buffers, the user must call CryptoCodecInterface::finalize method to get the output remainder.
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * CryptoCodecInterface::DataBlock plaintext = ...;
 * CryptoCodecInterface::Key key = ...;
 * CryptoCodecInterface::IV iv = ...;
 *
 * auto codec = cryptoFactory->createEncoder(AlgorithmType::AES_256_CBC_PAD);
 * cipher->init(key, iv);
 * CryptoCodecInterface::DataBlock ciphertext;
 * codec->encode(plaintext, &ciphertext);
 * codec->finalize(&ciphertext);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The interface allows processing of a continuous stream of data, broken into parts, as long as each part is mappable
 * into one of supported "process" inputs.
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * cipher->init(key, iv);
 * CryptoCodecInterface::DataBlock ciphertext;
 * // Encode data blocks
 * codec->process(plaintext1, ciphertext);
 * codec->process(plaintext2, ciphertext);
 * ...
 * codec->process(plaintextN, ciphertext);
 * codec->finalize(&ciphertext);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The instance of this class can be re-initialized for reuse by calling #init() method and supplying new key and IV.
 * This method resets codec state and prepares it for encoding/decoding new data. Key and IV can have the same value
 * or be different:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * // Encode the data with a key and first IV.
 * cipher->init(key, iv1);
 * codec->process(plaintext1, ciphertext1);
 * ...
 * codec->finalize(&ciphertext1);
 * // Reset the codec to re-encode data with the same key but different IV
 * codec->init(key, iv2)
 * codec->process(plaintext1, ciphertext2);
 * ...
 * codec->finalize(&ciphertext2);
 * @endcode
 *
 * * * *
 * ### Using Authenticated Encryption and Authenticated Decryption (AEAD) Algorithms
 *
 * #### Authenticated encryption
 *
 * For authenticated encryption, the algorithm takes key, initialization vector, additional authenticated data (AAD) and
 * plaintext (unencrypted data) as inputs, and produces ciphertext (encrypted data) and tag (also known as Message
 * Authentication Code/MAC) as outputs.
 *
 * Application must keep the key data secret, while initialization vector and tag can be stored or transferred along
 * ciphertext. The best practice is not to store AAD but to compute it depending on domain scenario. For example, when
 * encrypting property values, property key can be used as AAD, which would protect encrypted data from being reused for
 * a property with a different name.
 *
 * Overall, encryption process is similar to un-authenticated encryption, with the following differences:
 * * Caller must provide AAD right after initialization and before processing is done. AAD is optional, but recommended.
 * * Caller must get a tag (MAC) after encryption is finalized.
 *
 * After codec is initialized with #init() method, additional data is provided with #processAAD() calls before starting
 * encryption with #process() method calls. The tag is retrieved with #getTag() call after #finalize().
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * // Encrypt the data with a key and first IV.
 * cipher->init(key, iv1);
 * codec->processAAD(additionalAuthenticatedData);
 * ...
 * // Start encrypting data
 * codec->process(plaintext1, ciphertext1);
 * ...
 * codec->finalize(&ciphertext1);
 *
 * // Retrieve tag
 * codec->getTag(tag);
 * @endcode
 *
 * #### Authenticated Decryption
 *
 * For authenticated decryption, the algorithm takes key, initialization vector, additional authenticated data (AAD),
 * tag (also known as Message Authentication Code/MAC), and ciphertext (encrypted data) as inputs, and produces
 * plaintext (unencrypted data) as output.
 *
 * Overall, decryption process is similar to un-authenticated decryption, with the following differences:
 * * Caller must provide AAD right after initialization and before processing is done. AAD must be the same as one,
 *   used during authenticated encryption.
 * * Caller must set a tag (MAC) for verification before decryption is finalized.
 *
 * After codec is initialized with #init() method, additional data is provided with #processAAD() calls before starting
 * decryption with #process() method calls. The tag is set with #setTag() call before #finalize().
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * // Decrypt the data with a key and first IV.
 * cipher->init(key, iv1);
 * codec->processAAD(additionalAuthenticatedData);
 * ...
 * // Start decrypting data
 * codec->process(plaintext1, ciphertext1);
 * ...
 * // Set tag for verification
 * code->setTag(tag);
 * // Finalize the operation
 * codec->finalize(&ciphertext1);
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### Thread Safety
 *
 * This interface is not thread safe and caller must ensure only one thread can make calls at any time.
